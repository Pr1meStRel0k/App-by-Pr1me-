FUNCTIONALITY:
The code should work if the following conditions are met:
1. You have entered your Dropbox data correctly (all required)
2. You have correctly "packed" the program into an EXE file
P.S.: I understand that the program is very crude and has some flaws (and may not even work), but as a foundation for your own simple program, it will do.
